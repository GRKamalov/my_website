About me
=========

My name is Georgy Kamalov, and I'm coming from Moscow - the largest city in Europe and the most aesthetic city in the world. Prior to starting my Master's at LBS, I completed a *double-degree* Bachelor's programme in Mathematics and Economics, provided in collaboration by the LSE and the renowned Higher School of Economics, Moscow. 

Prior to starting this programme, I've managed to complete several internships, encompassing fintech, big pharma and investment banking. My professional endeavours are outlined in greater detail in the **CV** section of this website. 


What do I dream about?
====================

I am a passionate traveller, especially when it comes to mountains. Over the coming years I'm planning to visit some of the most inhospitable places of our planet, including Greenland and the Himalayas. And of course, I will be working towards my own discovery in Russia, where the potential for travelling is inifinite. 

Apart from that, my interests include boxing, military history, geography, and *classic science fiction*. The latter is one of my genuine passions, and I present a small sci-fi reading list in the corresponding section of this website.
